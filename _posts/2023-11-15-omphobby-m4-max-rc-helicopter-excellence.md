# Unleashing the OMPHobby M4 MAX: Elevating RC Helicopter Excellence

**Excitement takes flight with the all-new OMPHobby M4 MAX helicopter!**

Introducing the OMPHobby M4 MAX, a groundbreaking addition to the OMPHobby family that takes the proven M4 airframe to new heights. Designed by the talented Jonas Wackershauser, this sleek marvel boasts a range of features that redefine your RC helicopter experience.

## Key Features

### **Proven Foundation, Enhanced Performance**
Built upon the beloved M4 airframe, the MAX retains all the features enthusiasts adore. The inclusion of 420mm blades ensures lower disc loading, paving the way for smoother and more dynamic flying styles, delivering a floatier feeling in the skies.

### **Stylish Canopies for Every Mood**
Three new tri-colored canopies, designed with multi-colored paint schemes, provide not only a fresh aesthetic but also excellent visibility in all conditions. Coupled with white skids and a large carbon tail boom, the M4 MAX stands out on the flying field.

### **Powerful Propulsion**
The M4 MAX boasts a more powerful SUNNYSKY R80-7 main motor, over 30% larger than its predecessor. This motor delivers extraordinary torque at both low and high RPMs, ensuring a thrilling flight experience every time.

### **Tailored Tail Components**
The new tail boom and tail case enable the use of a wider belt for optimal power transfer to the tail. Dynamic weights in the tail rotor further reduce yaw servo loads, enhancing overall stability and control.
