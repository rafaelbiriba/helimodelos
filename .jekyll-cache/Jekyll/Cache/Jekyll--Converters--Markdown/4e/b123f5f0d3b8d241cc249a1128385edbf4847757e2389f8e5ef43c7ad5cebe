I"w<p>The first version of helimodelos.com blog was created in 2012 by <a href="https://rafaelbiriba.com/about-me" target="_blank">Rafael Biriba</a>.</p>

<p>Originally created in portuguese (Brazil), the main goal of the blog was to share news and tutoriais about the RC Helicopter world.</p>

<p>The naming Helimodelos comes from the portuguese <code>Heli + Modelos</code>, where <code>Heli</code> translates into Helicopters and <code>Modelos</code> translate into miniatures. So the literal translation would be Heliminiatures.</p>

<p>Around 2015, Rafael decided for a break on his hobbies and the original portuguese blog got deprecated fast.</p>

<p>But the history is not over! In 2022 the blog is returning, this time in both english and portuguese, trying to cover more ground and help more people!</p>

<p>The decision of keeping the <code>Helimodelos</code> naming was by purpose, to keep the blog history alive.</p>

<p>So, bookmark this page and wait for future news, posts and tutorials.</p>

<p>As always, suggestions and feedbacks are welcome! Feel free to approach us at <a href="/contact" target="_blank">contact page</a></p>
